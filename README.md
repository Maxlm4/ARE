# ARE

This Python project was done during my preparoty cycle for engineering school, in collaboration with 3 other students, but I was the only one using Github.

This project is a simulation of a bee population in an environment (simulated as a grid). Each tile of the grid can contain some bees, flowers, predators such as spiders or hornets, a bee hive or wasp hive... The whole grid is subject to time changes, season flow, reproduction rates and methods for each species and a pollution amoount. Each of these factors interact with each other, causing the population of bees to increase or decrease.

The main purpose of this project was to simulate the bee population changes depending on different factors, such as the hornet population or the amount of pollution. Using realistic values, we could predict with a relative accuracy (the model is not perfect) what a real bee popultaion could become after x years depending on their environment state.
